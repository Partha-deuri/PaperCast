# PaperCast: AI Podcast Debate Generator

🚀 **[Live Demo](https://papercast-parth.streamlit.app/)**

Turns 1-3 research papers (via arXiv IDs or local PDF uploads) into a debate-style podcast script between three
personas (Academic, Skeptic, Host), with citation grounding to catch hallucinated quotes, an optional human-in-the-loop review step, and a cost/latency dashboard.

## Architecture

```
ingest → academic_agent → grounding → rag_lookup → skeptic_agent → host_agent → review → (finalize)
         (per paper,        (verifies    (cross-refs   (critiques,    (writes the   ^
          1-3 papers)        citations    against local  incl. cross-   debate         |
                              against      library + live paper +       script)      +-- optional pause here,
                              source)      arxiv search)  external lit)                  toggled by human_in_loop
```

The **RAG layer** (`rag_lookup`) queries two sources per paper: a persistent
local Chroma library of every paper this tool has processed (grows across
runs - each run's papers get added to it), and a live arXiv search for
related work never seen before. Both feed into the Skeptic's
`external_literature_notes` - "is this claim supported or contradicted by
work outside the papers given in this run?" Embeddings run locally via
sentence-transformers - free, no API key - and this whole step is
best-effort: if Chroma, the embedding model, or arXiv search fail for any
reason, it logs a warning and continues with empty RAG context rather than
breaking the pipeline.

Built with **LangGraph** for orchestration (typed shared state, not just a
linear chain of function calls), **Pydantic** structured outputs everywhere
(no regex-parsing free-text LLM responses), and **Streamlit** for the
review/dashboard UI.

## Key design decisions (useful for interviews)

- **Structured output over free text.** Every agent call uses
  `.with_structured_output()` against a Pydantic schema, so a malformed
  response fails loudly and specifically rather than silently producing
  garbage downstream.
- **Citation grounding is not an LLM call.** It's plain fuzzy-string-matching
  (`src/citation_grounding.py`) run against the actual extracted paper text.
  This is deliberate - you don't want to ask a model "did you just make this
  quote up?" and trust the answer. Verified independently instead.
- **Graceful degradation on ingestion.** A paper whose PDF can't be parsed
  cleanly (scanned images, weird layout) falls back to abstract-only mode
  rather than crashing or silently passing empty text into an agent.
- **Human-in-the-loop is optional and toggleable**, implemented via
  LangGraph's `interrupt()`/`Command(resume=...)` primitives with a
  `MemorySaver` checkpointer. When off, `review_node` passes straight
  through - useful for scheduled/unattended runs.
- **Cost/latency tracked per node**, not just per run, and persisted to
  `logs/run_log.jsonl` across every run so the dashboard shows trends, not
  just a single execution's numbers.
- **MOCK_MODE** lets you exercise the entire graph - ingestion, grounding,
  cost tracking, HITL pause/resume - without an API key or spending money.
  This is how the graph wiring itself was verified during development.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env`: set `PODCAST_PROVIDER` to `gemini` (recommended, free, no
credit card - get a key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) or `groq`
(also free, no credit card - https://console.groq.com/keys), and paste the
matching key. Leave all keys blank to run in MOCK_MODE (no real LLM calls,
useful for checking the wiring works).

Anthropic is also supported (`PODCAST_PROVIDER=anthropic`) but has no
permanent free tier - only occasional, non-guaranteed trial credits.

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
# unattended run, no review pause
python -m src.main --papers 2306.07691 2310.06825 --no-human-in-loop

# with human review pause (prompts in terminal)
python -m src.main --papers 2306.07691 --human-in-loop

# generate an audio episode too (Kokoro TTS via kokoro-onnx, free, local,
# works on Python 3.10-3.13)
python -m src.main --papers 2306.07691 --no-human-in-loop --audio outputs/episode.wav
```

Audio generation needs the `kokoro-onnx` package (already in
`requirements.txt`) plus **two model files you download once manually**
(no auto-download - `kokoro-onnx` doesn't fetch them for you like the
torch-based `kokoro` package does):

```bash
curl -L -o kokoro-v1.0.int8.onnx https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/kokoro-v1.0.int8.onnx
curl -L -o voices-v1.0.bin https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/voices-v1.0.bin
```

Place both files in the project root (or pass custom paths to
`render_script_to_audio()` in `src/tts.py`). ~88MB + ~27MB, one-time
download, fully offline after that. Output is `.wav` (plays in any media
player) - see `convert_wav_to_mp3()` in `src/tts.py` if you want an actual
`.mp3` (requires `ffmpeg` + `pydub`).

> Why not the original `kokoro` PyPI package? It's torch-based and its
> releases cap out at Python <3.13. `kokoro-onnx` has no torch dependency
> and explicitly supports 3.10-3.13, at the cost of a one-time manual model
> download instead of an automatic one.

### Dashboard (recommended - has the review UI + charts)

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

Two tabs:
- **Run Pipeline** - enter arXiv IDs, toggle human-in-the-loop on/off, run.
  If paused, edit lines inline and approve. Once a final script exists, a
  "Generate Audio" button renders it with Kokoro TTS and plays it inline
  (with a download button) - disabled automatically if the model files
  aren't found in the project root.
- **Cost & Latency** - reads `logs/run_log.jsonl` across all runs ever
  executed, with per-node cost/latency bar charts and an error rate metric.

The sidebar always shows the active provider/model and whether MOCK_MODE is
on, and lets you point at custom model file paths for audio generation.

## Features & Capabilities

- **Local PDF & arXiv Support**: Multi-paper ingestion (1-3 papers) via arXiv IDs or direct PDF uploads, with retry/backoff and abstract-only fallback.
- **Domain-Specific Heuristics**: Model determines the domain of the paper to generate specialized skeptic critiques.
- Three-agent pipeline (Academic → Skeptic → Host) with cross-paper conflict detection.
- **Parallelized Agent Calls**: Academic and Ingestion agents run concurrently for drastically improved speeds.
- Citation grounding / anti-hallucination verification layer.
- **RAG layer**: cross-references each paper's claims against (a) a persistent
  local library of every paper this tool has processed, growing across runs,
  and (b) live arXiv search for related work never seen before. Feeds the
  Skeptic's `external_literature_notes`.
- **RAG Library Management**: View, delete, and clear the local Chroma database from the dashboard.
- Optional human-in-the-loop review, toggleable per run.
- Per-node cost and latency tracking with a Streamlit dashboard.
- **Docker Containerization**: Easily spin up the dashboard and dependencies using `docker-compose`.
- **Flexible LLM Support**: Use Gemini, Groq, Anthropic, or any OpenAI-compatible local model (Ollama, vLLM).
- Audio generation via **Edge TTS** (fast, cloud-based) or **Kokoro TTS** (free, local, per-persona voices).
